# IoT Gas Detection System
Final project for *EEL5739 â€” IoT Security and Privacy*\
This design is a secure system that monitors gas levels in a research facility, e.g. a lab that incorporates gas-powered equipment. A MQTT broker hosted by AWS is used to establish a  secure communication channel via SSL certificate encryption. Multiple IoT devices can be deployed for scalable detection capacity. Security challenges and risks are throughly detailed in a risk assessment.

[**TODO: add images and in-depth explanation of system functionality**]

The coding portion of the project that I contributed is included in this directory as a zip file. This zip contains the PlatformIO project files along with supplementary code used to deploy a receiver node on an ESP32 device.

## List of Projects
### [RISC-V Core](https://github.com/gcad-ee/RISCV)
In-progress, repo is currently private but will be made public once RV32I compliance is reached.
### [LoRaWAN Gateway System with Client Devices](/lorawan-system/README.md)

### [64-bit Ring Oscillator (RO) Physical Unclonable Function (PUF)](/64b-ro-puf/README.md)

### [MIPS ISA Compliant Processor](/mips-processor/README.md)

### [32-bit 12 Round Simon Cipher](/32b-12r-simon-cipher/README.md)

### [VLSI SRAM Column and Row Decoder Design](/iot-gas-detection-system/README.md)

### [IoT Gas Detection System](/iot-gas-detection-system/README.md)
Automatic gas detection system developed as a group for the final project of EEL5739 â€” *IoT Security and Privacy*. This system incorporates an MQTT broker hosted on AWS to transmit and collect data from ESP32 nodes. Alerts issued on dedicated MQTT channel to allow flexible response implementation.
